Drumblr is a Drupal installation profile that creates a Tumblr-like Drupal
site.  The installation profile includes a drush make file (drumblr.make) for
quickly downloading the required modules and themes.  The real functionality
comes from the drumblr_settings module which is a feature that creates the
content types and sets the necessary variables.

Content types:

* Page (blog post)
* Photo
* Video
* Quote
